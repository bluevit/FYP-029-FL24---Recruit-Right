# Recruit Right: Precision Hiring With AI Insight

## Overview
The RecruitRight is designed to streamline and optimize the hiring process. It leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to filter candidates based on job descriptions and provides an end-to-end solution for managing job postings, candidates, and interview sessions. The platform simplifies communication between organizations, candidates, and interview engineers.

This project is developed as part of our final year project for Dept. of Computing, Faculty of Engineering, Science and Technology, Hamdard University, Karachi.

## Key Features
- **Organization Management**: Organizations can create accounts, post job details, and upload resumes for evaluation.
- **NER-Enabled Resume Screening**: A Natural Entity Recognition (NER) tool scans resumes and matches them with job descriptions for efficient filtering.
- **Candidate Portal**: Candidates can sign up, create profiles, upload resumes, and select their availability slots.
- **Interviewer Portal**: Interview engineers can sign up, specify their expertise, and schedule interviews with shortlisted candidates.
- **Automated Scheduling**: Integrates interview sessions based on candidate and interviewer availability.
- **Google Meet/Zoom Integration**: Automatically generates meeting links for 1-on-1 interviews.
- **Assessment and Reporting**: Pre-defined Google Forms for interview assessments, generating reports shared with both organizations and candidates.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS
- **Database**: Firebase Real-Time Database
- **NLP Tool**: SpaCy (NER framework)
- **Cloud Services**: Firebase

## Future Enhancements
The platform's modular design allows for future additions, such as AI-powered interview feedback, multilingual support, and integration with proprietary HR systems.
